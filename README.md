Project Summary: Chemical Engineering Design Tools
Objective:

To develop Python-based tools for common chemical engineering tasks, including:

Oxygen Transfer Rate (OTR) Calculation: Simulate DO levels in an aeration tank, considering OTR and consumption rates.
Liquid-Liquid Extraction: Calculate distribution ratios and plot tie-line diagrams for ternary systems.
Distillation Column Design: Determine the number of theoretical stages and plot McCabe-Thiele diagrams for binary mixtures.
Reactor Design: Calculate reactor volumes for CSTR and PFR for first-order irreversible reactions.
